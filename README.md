### Project Description
Strava is an application that can record/track activities then share it to friends. Unfortunately, Strava is now pushing its users to subscribe to their premium tier. Some features, like the Calendar View Training Log, is now hidden behind a paywall. Some metrics and analysis are also more difficult to find now. My application's goal is to be able to get some of those features back and have my own analysis and dashboard (in the future).


### Project Objectives

1. Store Athlete Activities in a Database
2. Visualize Training Log in a Calendar Format
3. Show Athlete Stats
4. Show Weekly Mileage
5. Require authentication to access Athlete Data
